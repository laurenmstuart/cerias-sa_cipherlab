# cerias-sa_cipherlab
## Synopsis

Beginner and intermediate lab for substitution ciphers, in Python, with virtual machine image for uniform lab environment. 

## Motivation

This lab was created for CERIAS-SA (CERIAS Student Association) members with an interest in cryptography but little to no background. The event brought students in to meet others, work together, and starter skills in an information security topic.

## Contents

 - Event page, for posterity
 - CipherLab slides, the accompanying lecture for the lab
 - Handout, with highlights from the lecture for reference
 - caesar-lab.py, a source file for lab attendees to fill in code, with comment prompts
 - vigenere-lab.py, a source file for lab attendees to fill in code, with comment prompts
 - challenge_ciphertext_caesar.txt, a text file containing a caesar ciphertext, for intermediate students to attempt to decipher
 - challenge_ciphertext_vigenere.txt, a text file containing a vigenere ciphertext, for intermediate students to decipher
 - (solution) challenge_plaintext.txt, the associated plaintext 
 - (solution) caesar-solution.py, a source file illustrating one way of solving the caesar-lab
 - (solution) vigenere-solution.py, a source file illustrating one way of solving the vigenere-lab
 
 NOT included:
